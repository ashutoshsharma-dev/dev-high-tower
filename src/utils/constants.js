const page2A = (fname) => {
  return `Hey there, ${fname}!`;
};

const page3 = (fname, lname) => {
  return `You’re probably wondering how I got into this situation—standing in front of a powerful wizard, waiting to be punished for breaking the rules.

Well, it all started on what seemed like just another regular day at school. After class, I headed to my locker to grab my things before going home. That’s when I saw a mysterious, shimmering envelope inside, with my name written in gold letters. I carefully opened it, and suddenly a swirl of sparkling mist burst from the paper, filling the hallway with twinkling golden confetti. Whoa! What was going on?

"Dear ${fname} ${lname},

You are invited to attend the Hightower School for Magical 
Kids, a place of learning for young wizards and witches. Your classes will begin tomorrow, and we expect all new students to be in attendance.

Yours in magic,
Principal R. Magnus”

Um… okay? What’s going on here!? A school for witches and wizards? I stared at the letter in my hand. Was this some kind of prank?

The next day, when I got to school, I opened my locker door—and immediately slammed it shut. There was a kid dressed in wizard’s robes inside my locker! Was I imagining this? I slowly opened it again to peek inside, and before I could move or make a sound, he grabbed my shirt, pulled me in, and shut the door. 
`;
};

const page4 = (fname, lname) => {
  return `Before I could even react, the kid pulled a wand from his robe, pointed it at the back of the locker, and chanted with a confident flourish, “Revelare Hightower!”

The back of the locker magically opened, revealing a hallway in a completely different school! I stared in awe at my surroundings. The school looked like a grand, old castle, with rich granite walls and towering archways. The kid who had pulled me through handed me a piece of paper, told me to find Homeroom 113, and walked off, leaving me to figure out what in the world was going on!

The paper had my name written in shimmering golden letters at the top, followed by a homeroom number:

${fname}  ${lname}, Homeroom 113

Below that was a timetable listing the weirdest classes: Crystal Conjuring, Levitation for Beginners, Potions 101, Beginner’s Spells, and more. I blinked at the list. Was I dreaming?

I looked around the corridor, lined with hundreds of lockers and brimming with confused students. Some were climbing out of lockers themselves, guided by kids in robes.

“All new students, please make your way to your assigned homerooms,” the PA system blared.

The hallways twisted in so many directions that I was soon lost. Almost as if sensing my confusion, the paper in my hand folded itself into a little airplane, swooped into the air, and zoomed down the corridor. “Follow me,” it seemed to say.

`;
};

const page5 = (fname) => {
  return `“Uh, okay?” I mumbled, chasing after it. Magic at this school wasn’t just in textbooks, it seemed—it was everywhere!

The paper airplane led me down a twisting hallway, dodging enchanted objects as it flew. I was panting, struggling to keep up. I glanced around in awe as brooms swept the floor on their own and books floated beside students, reading aloud in soft whispers. As I walked by, I peeked inside one of the homerooms and saw a chalkboard scribbling notes all on its own!

Finally, the paper airplane darted straight into a door labeled "Homeroom 113."

I took a deep breath and stepped inside. The paper airplane zoomed directly toward a woman waiting behind the desk. “You must be ${fname},” she said with a kind smile. “Welcome to the Hightower School for Magical Kids. I’m Professor Baptisia Alba.”

She gestured for me to take a seat as I looked around at a classroom full of befuddled students. “You are all kids with magical gifts,” Professor Alba explained. “Here at Hightower, you will learn to control your magical powers and use them to help others.”

I’ve never even done so much as a card trick before, I thought. Surely, I don’t belong here.

I raised my hand. “Sorry, Ms. Alba, but I think there’s been some kind of mistake. I don’t know anything about magic. I might be in the wrong place.”`;
};

const page6 = (fname) => {
  return `“Oh, you’re not,” Ms. Alba said, smiling as her eyes sparkled. “Everyone here has magical abilities, whether they know about it or not. This school will help you learn to control your magic. And don’t worry, ${fname}, if you ever feel lost, I’m always here to help. But first, it’s time for the wand ceremony!”

Ms. Alba instructed us to put on our wizarding robes, which were tucked under our desks, and led us into the Grand Hall. Nervous-looking students from other homerooms were also shuffling in.

I was still confused. What exactly was a wand ceremony? And was I supposed to do something? Suddenly, a tall, important-looking teacher stood up on the stage in front of us, and a hush spread across the hall.

“Welcome to Hightower, young witches and wizards,” he said in a deep, commanding voice. “I am Rydric Magnus, your school principal. As per the traditions of Hightower, we must begin with the wand ceremony!” He then grabbed a large sack, which seemed filled to the brim, and flung it into the air. Hundreds of wands flew out and started to rain down upon us. I quickly covered my head with my hands to shield myself. Some kids tried to hide under the tables.

When I felt brave enough to look up, I noticed a wand hovering right next to me. I stared at it as it nudged my hand. Then, when I moved back, it came forward and nudged me once more. I tried to back off, but the wand just wouldn’t leave me alone.

“Looks like it's chosen you, ${fname},” said Ms. Alba. I opened my hand, and the wand flew straight in. It felt warm and friendly, and I instantly knew this was my wand.`;
};

const page7 = (fname) => {
  return `For the next hour, we all stood in the Grand Hall, getting to know our wands. Even though I knew absolutely no spells, it was a thrill to discover that by swishing my wand around, I could produce a small firework display of sparks. Cool!

Just when I was getting the hang of creating a shower of fizzing flares, Principal Magnus, in his long, flowing, dark purple robes, stepped back onto the stage. Everybody piped down. He looked proudly at us over the frames of his glasses and said,

“Dear students, in time, your wand will become an extension of yourself. Remember, it is not the wand that wields the power—it is the heart and mind of the wizard that breathes life into the spells. Use it wisely, and use it for good.” We all looked with wonderment at our wands. “Now,” Principal Magnus continued, “let the classes begin!”

The next few weeks flew by. I was doing really well at my new school, and learning magic was so exciting. I was having a lot of fun!

But it didn’t last. During a Potions 101 lesson one day, we were mixing up enchantment elixirs with mermaid tears and elvish elderflower. As I walked by the class bully, Zelda, she stuck out her pointed boot and tripped me, causing me to accidentally bump into a cauldron. The gurgling brew splashed... right onto her boots!

Zelda shrieked, and her eyes narrowed. “You’ve ruined my favorite shoes, you butterbrain, ${fname}!”`;
};

const page10 = (fname, lname) => {
  return `In the center, on a pedestal, rested the legendary Magic Hat of Wisdom. It looked like a simple old wizard's hat, but I could feel its magical powers humming in the air. I approached it cautiously, thinking, “Okay, Magic Hat, I really need your help.” But first, I had to tickle its funny bone. Time to get creative, ${fname}.

“Hello, Magic Hat,” I said, my voice shaking just a little. “I heard you like jokes.”

The hat spun in place, and a booming voice filled the room. “Who dares summon me? If it’s wisdom you seek, a joke you must speak.”

I gulped. “I’m ${fname} ${lname}. And umm...why don’t [wizards/witches] wear flat hats?”

The Magic Hat didn’t move. There was an eerie silence in the chamber.

“Because there’s no point!” I finished with the punchline. For a moment, nothing happened. Oh no, I thought, suddenly panicking. Did my joke not work? I thought it was pretty funny.

Suddenly, the Magic Hat wobbled on its brim, shaking slightly at first. Its pointed top bent over like it was trying to stifle a giggle. Then, it tipped back, and a booming laugh erupted from inside, echoing through the room. The brim flapped wildly, as if it were clapping with joy. The hat spun in circles, unable to stop laughing, and tiny sparks of magic fizzled out like confetti, lighting up the air. 

 “Bravo! Magnifico!” the hat gasped between its laughter. “That’s a good one!”`;
};

const page11 = (fname) => {
  return `The Magic Hat floated down from its pedestal and landed on my head with a whoosh. “I see great things in you, ${fname},” it said. I blushed and stuffed my hands into the pocket of my robe.

The Magic Hat hummed softly, as it read my mind. “I can see that you have a challenge on your hands that is causing you to lose sleep. You’ve only been here a few weeks, and you already have a nemesis. Tut tut tut. But, I’ll tell you what, why don’t I teach you a spell that might solve your little Zelda problem!” I nodded eagerly.

“Alright,” said the Magic Hat reassuringly, “When you face Zelda at the duel, try this spell: Monstro Miragium!”

“What does it do?” I asked cautiously. The Magic Hat chuckled. “Oh, you’ll see! Just make sure it’s aimed at the right target.” I raised an eyebrow. “And what if it’s not?”

The Magic Hat snickered. “Well, then you might turn your shoes into dancing frogs. Or your wand into a chicken—who knows? But remember this, young [witch/wizard], fortune favors the bold! Now, off you go! You’re already late for Professor Alba’s class!"

I rushed out of the Chamber of Wisdom, and scrambled out of the passageway into the Great Hall, quickly trying to slip unnoticed into the main hallway of the school. I raced to Professor Alba’s classroom and received a stern glare when I burst in. `;
};

const page12 = (fname) => {
  return `"Good morning, ${fname}. I must remind you that, according to school policy, your unfortunate lateness must be corrected with detention. You will meet me in the library at 2 o’clock this afternoon. Now, please sit down.”

2 o’clock today? Oh no.

Now what was I going to do? I had the duel with Zelda at 2 o’clock, and if I didn’t go there and finish things off with her, I would never get any peace around this school... or sleep at night! As for detention with Ms. Alba, there was no getting out of that either.

My only hope was to go back to the Magic Hat and ask for help. If I could make the hat laugh again, maybe it would help me get out of this mess.

After class, I made my way back to the Chamber of Wisdom, my heart pounding with anticipation. Standing before the massive oak door again, I was relieved that it didn’t make me solve another riddle and opened automatically, as if to say, “Welcome back, ${fname}.”

Inside, the Magic Hat was sitting on its perch. It raised its brim slightly, like a raised eyebrow, as it heard me enter. I tried to calm my nerves and prepared to try and make the hat laugh a second time. 

“Err, hello again, Magic Hat… I was just thinking I had another joke you might enjoy.”

“Go on…” the Magic Hat encouraged.`;
};

const page13 = (fname) => {
  return `Um… so, what do you call a magic dog?” I began, my voice steady this time. “A magic dog, you say?” the hat pondered. “Why, I can’t say I know.” I took a deep breath and then burst out with, “A labracadabrador!”

The Magic Hat erupted into joyous laughter, its brim shaking with delight. “Brilliant! You’ve got a great sense of humor, ${fname}!” I couldn’t help but laugh too, picturing a cute Labrador strutting through the halls of Hightower in wizard’s robes!

As the laughter faded, the Magic Hat swooped onto my head, glowing brightly as it read my mind. “I see! You need to be in two places at once. Your jokes made my day, so I will grant you another spell: Duplico Geminus. Use it wisely, but be quick! You’ll need to say it right before detention!” 

Relief flooded through me—this was my chance! A quick glance at the clock hanging on the chamber wall told me I had only five minutes to get to detention... and to Zelda. "Thanks a lot, Magic Hat," I muttered, sprinting out the door toward the library. "Here goes," I thought, gathering my courage. Pulling out my wand, I whispered, "Duplico Geminus!"

Something astonishing happened! A clone appeared right in front of me—an exact replica of myself! It was as if I were staring into a mirror. The clone turned to me and said, “The spell will only last for one hour, so get a move on, ${fname}!” Then it opened the library door, gave me a cheeky wink, and slipped inside to attend detention, ready to charm Professor Alba. I dashed off to my duel with Zelda.`;
};

const page14 = (fname) => {
  return `When I walked over the hill behind the Lunch Hall, I could see that a crowd of students had gathered to watch our duel.

“There you are, ${fname}. You’re late. I thought you might've chickened out.” Zelda sneered, striding forward with fists clenched, ready to strike. “Prepare to lose.”

Without another word, she whipped out her wand from her robe and, with a flick, unleashed a bright purple blast that whizzed past my ear as I ducked. “Oops!” she mocked. “Did that scare you?”

I took a deep breath and steadied myself.`;
};

const page15 = (fname) => {
  return `The next day, Principal Magnus called me into his office. And that’s how I ended up here. Like I told you at the beginning of this story, things were not looking good for me—a new student, already getting called into the Principal’s office. Had skipping detention broken some mega-rule? Was I about to be suspended? Expelled? I didn’t want this magical journey to end!

Principal Magnus looked at me over his glasses. “I hear you have been participating in some creative magic, ${fname},” he said, raising an eyebrow. “Not much gets past me at Hightower. I’m sure you are aware,” he went on sternly, “that skipping detention is against the rules—not a habit we want to encourage.”

My heart pounded so hard I could hardly hear him—until he chuckled.

“But don’t worry,” he continued. “You’re not in trouble. The Magic Hat told me everything. Zelda should not have threatened you like that. We don’t tolerate bullying here at Hightower. She has been warned.” I felt a weight lift off my shoulders knowing that my time at Hightower was not coming to an end.

Principal Magnus then leaned in with a smile. “You must have quite the sense of humor to get the Magic Hat to help you twice in one day. But this pesky hat is not getting off easy. Oh no,” he added, wagging a finger at the hat. “We’ll be having a very serious chat about helping students break the rules with magic.”

I grinned and looked at the Magic Hat sheepishly.`;
};

const page16 = (fname, lname) => {
  return `As I left Principal Magnus' office, a wave of relief washed over me—I wasn’t in trouble anymore. Strolling down the hall, I couldn’t help but think about how incredible the last few weeks had been, ever since I got the invitation to attend this amazing school.

I was still lost in my thoughts, gazing out at the magnificent school gardens, when Professor Alba walked by and quickly turned to face me. “You’ve been busy, ${fname}, haven’t you?” she said, with a frown on her face. "I know you were in a tough spot earlier," she said, her tone softening, "but don’t make a habit of sending clones to detention."

“Sorry, Ms. Alba,” I mumbled, a bit embarrassed. “I didn't mean to cause any trouble. It won’t happen again.” She smiled and replied, “I understand. However, you still need to complete detention. So, I’ll see you in the library this afternoon. And I might have a surprise for you!”

Later that day, when I arrived at detention, Ms. Alba handed me a pamphlet. The Levitating Dodgeball trials were starting next week! My heart raced with excitement. “I think you’re going to be really great at this, ${fname},” she said with a kind smile. “I hope you try out for the school team."

How much fun would it be to learn how to levitate!? And play enchanted dodgeball while levitating? Sign me up!

When I first arrived at Hightower, I felt out of place, like there had been some kind of mistake. But now, after everything—especially dealing with Zelda—I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be. And no matter what came my way, I could pretty much take care of myself.

My name is ${fname} ${lname}, [wizard/witch] in training, at the Hightower School for Magical Kids, and I think I’m going to get really good at this magic stuff!`;
